        <h1>WHAT IS ENERGY ?</h1><br>
        <p>Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It’s the force behind everything that happens, from powering devices and moving objects to enabling plants to grow.</p><br>
        <p>Energy is a basic part of everything in the universe. It’s what allows us to move, grow, and think. At its core, energy enables all physical and chemical processes, meaning every action—whether it’s the sun shining, a car moving, or even our own bodies working—relies on some form of energy.</p>

        It comes in various forms, such as:<br><br>

        1. Kinetic Energy, which is energy in motion.<br>
        2. Potential Energy, or stored energy due to position.<br>
        3. Thermal Energy, related to heat and the movement of particles within a substance.<br>
        4. Chemical Energy, found in the bonds of molecules.<br>
        5. Electrical Energy, from the flow of electric charge.<br><br>
        Energy constantly changes forms but is never created or destroyed, a principle known as the law of conservation of energy.</p><br>

            <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are becoming increasingly important as the world transitions to a more sustainable future.</p>

            <h2>Green Energy</h2>
            <p>Green energy sources such as geothermal, biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells are becoming increasingly popular as the world seeks to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

            <p>Energy conservation is critical to reducing our environmental impact and promoting sustainable development.</p>

            <h2>Difference Between Renewable Energy and Green Energy</h2>
            <p>While all green energy is renewable, not all renewable energy is considered green. Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, can be sustainable and have a minimal environmental impact. However, some renewable sources, like certain types of biomass or hydroelectric power, can have adverse environmental effects. Green energy refers specifically to renewable energy sources that are environmentally friendly and have a low impact on the planet.</p>
